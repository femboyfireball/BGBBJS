# A Beginner's Guide to BitBurner and JavaScript
Welcome to my guide on BitBurner where we go from zero knowledge on JavaScript (Or TypeScript, if you so choose) to a fully fledged script to hack the best server!

### What you need
* Obviously, you'll need access to BitBurner. It can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) or on the internet as two seperate builds. [Main (stable)](https://bitburner-official.github.io/) or [Dev](https://bitburner-official.github.io/bitburner-src/)
* Yes, that's it!
